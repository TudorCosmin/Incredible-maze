Project for introduction to robotics optional course


## Game description
In this panning-camera maze game, players must navigate from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the LED matrix display as quickly as possible using a joystick. The game is played by moving the joystick in different directions to move a cursor through the maze. The maze consists of a series of puzzles, obstacles and challenges that the player must overcome.

However, there is a catch: the maze is filled with invisible bombs that will explode if the player comes too close! To help navigate the maze, a LED will turn on if the player is within one move of a bomb, alerting them to the danger. The player must avoid touching the walls of the maze and the invisible bombs at all costs, as a single mistake will result in the game being over.

The game is won by successfully navigating through the entire maze and reaching the bottom-right corner without touching any walls or bombs. The LED matrix display provides a unique and visually stunning way to experience the maze, as the camera pans and shifts to follow the cursor's movements through the twists and turns of the game. With its fast-paced gameplay and challenging obstacles, this panning-camera maze game is sure to keep players on the edge of their seats.

## Game backstory
I had the idea to create a maze game that used the panning camera feature to give players a more immersive experience. Futhermore, I was particularly interested in the idea of using invisible bombs as a way to add an element of surprise and challenge to the game. I felt that this would give players a sense of tension and excitement as they navigated the maze, wondering when the next bomb might appear and how to avoid it.

I decided to create this game because I wanted to offer players a unique and exciting gaming experience that they couldn't find anywhere else. I knew that the combination of the simplicity of Arduino control and LED matrix display and the complexity of the puzles would allow you to create a game that was visually stunning and highly immersive, and you were excited to see how players would react to the challenge of navigating the maze and avoiding the invisible bombs.
